## i-Audit Copilot Project - Enhanced Call Audit System
### Overview:
The 'i-Audit Copilot' project was initiated to optimize the performance of customer support centers, where call agents serve as the frontline representatives, handling diverse customer inquiries. Traditional methods of call auditing proved cumbersome and subjective, often requiring manual listening to recorded calls, particularly burdensome for organizations dealing with high call volumes. To overcome these challenges, our solution harnessed cutting-edge voice-to-text conversion technology, revolutionizing the auditing process.
### Key Contributions:
• Spearheading a dynamic team of 5-6 individuals, I led the development of an enhanced call audit system, prioritizing efficiency and quality in a customer-centric environment.

• Leveraged innovative voice-to-text conversion technology and a hybrid model blending deep learning and statistical techniques to effectively identify areas for improvement in call agent performance.

• Addressed the limitations of traditional auditing methods by automating the process and enhancing objectivity, resulting in significant time and resource savings for the organization.

• Ensured seamless communication and collaboration among team members, fostering a culture of innovation and excellence in project execution.

### Impact:
Through collaborative innovation and diligent teamwork, we delivered a transformative solution that significantly elevated call auditing standards, ultimately enhancing customer satisfaction and organizational performance. The 'i-Audit Copilot' project stands as a testament to our commitment to excellence and innovation in addressing complex business challenges.


## Intelligent-Insight: Root Cause Analysis for Printer-Offline Issues
### Overview:
As the lead data scientist, I spearheaded the 'Intelligent-Insight' project aimed at addressing the persistent challenge of identifying the root cause of printer-offline issues, a significant source of service calls for HP. These issues encompass various factors, including access point unavailability, weak signal strength, firmware problems, and issues with internet service providers. The complexity lies in the multitude of factors contributing to each issue, making efficient root cause identification a daunting task. The project's overarching goal was to develop an efficient and accurate method to streamline the resolution process, ultimately enhancing customer experience and reducing service costs.

### Leadership and Technical Contribution:
In addition to providing technical guidance, I played a pivotal role in fostering collaboration among team members, ensuring seamless communication, and maintaining a cohesive team environment. I led the team through the comprehensive data understanding phase, involving CDAX (Failure call records) and PSDR (Telemetry data from printers). This phase required meticulous data preprocessing, encompassing tasks such as handling missing values, managing outliers, and encoding categorical data. Addressing the challenge of intersecting and creating sequences from the CDAX and PSDR datasets, I proposed a solution that identified intersections between the two datasets, categorizing calls into T1 (Pre-Call, no issue), T2 (Issues during the CDAX call time frame), and T3 (Post Call, no issue). This automated process facilitated efficient issue identification rules, significantly contributing to the project's success.

### Impact:
Our innovative approach led to significant improvements in operational efficiency and productivity. Previously, manual processing and labeling of one call required approximately 2-3 hours. With our new automated approach, we can process and label over 8000 calls in less than an hour, reducing the processing time per call to just a few milliseconds.


## Call Summarization using Gen-AI
### Overview:
• In a fast-paced environment where call agents handle diverse queries, maintaining accurate case notes while engaging with customers can be challenging. Our project, "Call Summarization using Gen-AI," aims to streamline this process by summarizing conversations between agents and customers, creating structured case notes for enhanced understanding and analysis of customer needs.
### Technical Approach:
• Utilizing the LLAMA2-7B Model, we conducted a compact Proof of Concept (POC) with promising results. Our solution capitalizes on the LLAMA2 model, running locally to ensure data security and confidentiality within the HP network. Additionally, we continuously explore newer Large Language Models (LLMs) to optimize outcomes.

### Key Advantages:
• AI-generated structured case notes ensure consistency across cases, saving significant time for agents.

• Enhanced understanding of customer pain points benefits various teams:

	• Research and Development leverages valuable data for analysis
	• The Audit team gains clarity on call intricacies
	• The Customer Obsession team better addresses customer needs
	• The Reporting & Analytics Team utilizes comprehensive case notes for in-depth analysis

## Part Failure Prediction for High-end Printers
### Overview:

The project focused on critical component failure prediction and diagnostics for high-end HP printers. Our objective was to develop a model capable of predicting failure parts in advance, leveraging telemetry datasets containing error codes, timestamps, and failure datasets with component information and timestamps.

### Key Contributions:

• Utilized advanced machine learning techniques to develop a predictive model for failure prediction, ensuring alignment with business needs

• Identified and optimized machine learning metrics to enhance the model's performance, achieving the required precision and recall limits

• Leveraged the regional and functional hierarchy within printer error codes to extract valuable insights and improve prediction accuracy

• Successfully developed and implemented a robust model for part failure prediction, contributing to proactive maintenance strategies and minimizing printer downtime

### Impact:
• Improved operational efficiency by enabling proactive maintenance and minimizing unplanned downtime

• Enhanced customer satisfaction by ensuring uninterrupted printer performance and timely resolution of issues

• Contributed to cost savings by reducing the need for emergency repairs and replacement of critical components
